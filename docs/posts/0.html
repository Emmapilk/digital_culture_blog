Are you also seeking love, but not feeling the chemistry around the people you see everyday? Perhaps you should try Tinder?
Are you sick and tired of facing the same people every day, who you know you'll never develop feelings towards? Or perhaps you are just too shy to take that extra step, and ask the person who catches your interest out on a date? Or maybe you are just too afraid to take initiative, in case the feeling isn't mutual, and then fear the awkwardness the next day, when you are forced to sit next to this person at work, or in school? I have been on the app Tinder for a while now, and feel much more comfortable. I am able to check them out before I even have to talk to them, and if they like me back, we can get to know each other a little better before I decide whether I want to go forward with it. It makes life so much easier, because I don't fear getting rejected. I only get to see and chat with the people who find me interesting, which in fact is a lot. It surprises me every time, and it always gives me such a boost of confidence. It's a long time since I've felt so pleased with myself, and I can't get enough of it. I have yet to find my prince charming, even though I've been on a couple of dates already, but it is definitely a step in the right direction. There has not been a lot of action the last couple of months, and now I get to go on dates all the time. I would definitely recommend you to try this out, if you're not already on it. I would love to hear your experiences with it, and what you think about it - so please throw a comment down below.
Sending you all the best,

lots of love, Emma xoxo &#128525;
