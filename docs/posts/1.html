A new exciting way to experience dating someone through VIRTUAL REALITY?!?!
Hello everyone &#x1f604; I can't wait to share this news with all of you. A couple of weeks ago, I got picked out as a participant to a new experiment that has to do with virtual reality? Can you believe it? I feel so lucky &#x1f604; well, anyway... So yesterday I tried it for the first time, and when i took on the VR glasses, I got to see the avatar that they had created for me. It was so crazy to experience, because it really looked like me, and contained a lot of my characteristic traits, and then afterwards, the whole world changed around me, even though i was just sitting in my bedroom. And the best part was, that i felt like the space we were in, was created just for me. Of course it didn't look like the real world, but it was beautiful. I was sitting at a table by the beach, and after a short time, the guy they had matched me with popped up right opposite me. He looked so handsome, or well... his avatar was really good looking - I hope the resemblance is close to what he looks like in real life. But it was really awkward in the start. I think maybe because it was all so new to me - it wasn't similar to anything I had ever experienced before. But after some time, we really got on well with one another, and the conversation was flowing. The funniest part was, that I was just sitting in my nighties, and hadn't even showered that day. But that didn't really matter, because he couldn't see what i looked like in real life anyway. Now that I think about it, it was actually a relief, not having to worry about my makeup melting off my face, or black eyeliner goo stuck in the corner of my eye. I could really just relax, and concentrate on what he was saying, and how I would respond, without getting distracted by narcissistic thoughts about what i looked like in real life while talking to him. As you know, first impressions mean everything &#x1f609; Anyway, we ended our date on a high note, and i get to meet him in virtual reality again next week for another date. I really hope that this way of dating will take off, and become something everyone can get the chance to try, because it was an amazing experience. If you guys ever get the chance to try something similar, then grab that opportunity, you won't regret it.

Sending happy thoughts to all of you, and wishing you the best.
